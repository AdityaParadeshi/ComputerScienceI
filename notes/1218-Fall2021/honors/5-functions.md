## Functions & Methods
### Fall 2021

* A *function* is a reusable unit of code that may take input(s) and may produce an output
* Already familiar with functions: `main(), printf(), sqrt()`, etc.
* Familiar with functions from math: $f(x) = x^2$
  * Input: $x$
  * Output: $y = x^2$
  * You can also have multivariate functions: $f(x, y)$, $f(x, y, z)$, $f()$
* Functions facilitate code reuse: you don't have to copy-pasta chunks of code; instead you put them into a function and then *call* or *invoke* the function
* DRY Principle: Don't Repeat Yourself!
* Procedural Abstraction:
  * How does `sin()` work?
  * Taylor Series, Numerical Interpolation
  * A: who cares?  We simply want to use that functionality and NOT have to worry about the details
* By *encapsulating* functionality into functions, then we don't have to think about the details
* Standard libraries and external libraries come with a LOT of testing, debugging and optimization that you *cannot* hope to replicate!
* Generally you don't want to "roll your own" functionality unless you have to
* You don't want to reinvent the wheel
* Problem solving: when asked to solve a problem, what is the first question you should ask?
* A: is it already solved (or at least mostly solved)
* Always look for "off the shelf" solutions

## Functions in C

* As with variables, functions must be declared before you can use them
* In C you "declare" a function using a *prototype*
* A prototype declares a function's *signature*
  * Its identifier: its name
  * The type of variable it returns and
  * Any parameter types (inputs) it takes
